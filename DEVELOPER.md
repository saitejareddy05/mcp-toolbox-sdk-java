# Development

Below are the details to set up a development environment and run tests for the `mcp-toolbox-sdk-java` SDK.

## Versioning

This library adheres to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/). 

## Processes

### Conventional Commit Messages

This repository utilizes [Conventional
Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) for structuring commit messages.

## Install and Run Locally
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/googleapis/mcp-toolbox-sdk-java
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
    cd mcp-toolbox-sdk-java
    ```

3. Build the project:
   ```bash
    mvn clean install
    ```
This will generate the package JAR in your local `.m2` repository, making it available for other local Maven projects.

## Release Process

This repository uses [Release Please](https://github.com/googleapis/release-please) to automate the release process.

1.  **Pull Requests**: When code is merged into the `main` branch, Release Please analyzes the commit messages (which must follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/)).
2.  **Release PR**: Release Please creates or updates a special "Release PR" that updates the `CHANGELOG.md` and bumps the version in `pom.xml`.
3.  **Release Creation**: When a maintainer approves and merges the Release PR, Release Please tags the commit, creates a GitHub Release, and triggers the publishing workflow (to Maven Central).

Use this package in your test application.

## Testing

### Local Tests

To run tests locally, ensure you have the necessary dependencies and a running
MCP Toolbox service.

1. Create a new Java project (differnet from the SDK project).
2. Copy the source code from [`example`](./example/) folder of this repo ([ExampleUsage.java](./example/ExampleUsage.java)) to the `src`.
3. Copy the [`pom.xml`](./example/pom.xml) content from [`example`](./example/) to the new project.
4. Make the necesary changes for your `YOUR_TOOLBOX_SERVICE_ENDPOINT` and the `YOUR_CREDENTIALS_JSON_FILE_PATH` placeholders.
5. Run the following command to test:
   ```bash
   mvn clean compile exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="cloudcode.helloworld.ExampleUsage"
   ```

## Linting and Formatting

This project uses `com.spotify.fmt:fmt-maven-plugin` for formatting.

Format your code using
```bash
mvn com.spotify.fmt:fmt-maven-plugin:format
```

# Contributing to the SDK

2. Discussing the current state of the code

3. Submitting a fix

4. Proposing new features

5. Becoming a maintainer

### We Develop with Github

We use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## Contribution Process

We welcome contributions to this project! Please review the following guidelines
before submitting.

### Contributor License Agreement

Contributions to this project must be accompanied by a [Contributor License
Agreement](https://cla.developers.google.com/about) (CLA). Read more [here](./CONTRIBUTING.md)

### Code Reviews

All submissions, including those by project members, require review. We use
[GitHub pull requests](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/)
for this purpose.

* Ensure your pull request clearly describes the changes you are making.
* Ideally, your pull request should include code, tests, and updated
  documentation (if applicable) in a single submission.
* A reviewer from our team will typically review your
  PR within 2-5 days and may request changes or approve it.

### Report bugs using Github's issue tracker

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by opening a new issue, it's that easy!

Great Bug Reports tend to have:

1. A quick summary and/or background

2. Steps to reproduce

3. Be specific!

4. Give sample code if you can.

5. What you expected would happen

6. What actually happened

7. Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

### Coding Style & Standards

1. We use standard Java naming conventions.

2. Use CompletableFuture for all network operations to maintain the async-first architecture.

3. Keep dependencies minimal. Do not add new libraries unless absolutely necessary.
